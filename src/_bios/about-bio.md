I'm Chris: a developer with a passion for all things front-end. I REALLY like the applications I build to be fast - which is why I'm particularly fond of working with serverless technology at the moment.

I enjoy counting the kilobytes of my Javascript and making my production scripts as tiny as possible; I love writing well-structured vanilla and keeping my beady eye on the ECMAScript spec. If the project requires it, my current choice of framework is VueJS combined with VueX (and maybe NuxtJS if I'm going to server side render it).

Unsurprisingly, I like to squeeze my CSS down too - PostCSS in the build process is preferable and structuring my classes with the BEM methodology (or equivalent) in mind makes me happy.

I'm also a sucker for good usability and a tasty design.

For (almost) the last three years, I've been lead front-end developer at Breakthrough Media where I've built some interesting projects to do with social challenges such as extremism and conflict. Before that, I was freelancing: working on brands such as Converse and BT. And before THAT, I started my career in the seaside city of Bournemouth where, after taking a summer placement at an agency, I was persuaded to work and finish my degree at the same time. I honed my skillset there for the subsequent six years before moving to London in 2015.

When I'm not writing code, I work hard with my band Young Astronaut and enjoy taking pictures.
