I'm Chris, a software engineer with a passion for all things front-end. I like the applications I build to feel fast, regardless of the user's device and network condition which is why I'm particularly fond of web performance. I've spoken at [Google's web day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pTm8M9Jbn8&ab_channel=GoogleChromeDevelopers) and contributed to [Google's web.dev blog](https://web.dev/telegraph/) about my work with [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).

I've helped build company's design systems, code standards, testing strategies, error monitoring as well as day to day development using an array of programming languages and frameworks.

If you want to get in touch about a project you think may be of interest to me, my email address is [chris@chrisboakes.com](mailto:chris@chrisboakes.com).
