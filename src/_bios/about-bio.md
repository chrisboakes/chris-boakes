I’m Chris: a developer with a passion for all things front-end. I REALLY like the applications I build to be fast - which is why I’m particularly interested in web performance. I’m also a sucker for good usability and a tasty design.

I'm the principal software engineer at [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/) where I build and maintain their news site and web applications. Before that I was lead front-end developer at Breakthrough Media where I built some interesting projects to do with social challenges such as extremism and conflict.

If you want to get in touch about a project you think may be of interest to me, my email address is [chris@chrisboakes.com](mailto:chris@chrisboakes.com).

When I’m not writing code, I work hard with my band [Young Astronaut](https://youngastronaut.co.uk/) and enjoy [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/crboakes/).
