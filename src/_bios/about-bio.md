I’m Chris: a developer with a passion for all things front-end. I REALLY like the applications I build to be fast - which is why I’m particularly fond of working with the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) approach at the moment.

I enjoy counting the kilobytes of my JavaScript and making my production scripts as tiny as possible; I love writing well-structured vanilla JavaScript and learning/using/experimenting with new features of ECMAScript spec. I’m a sucker for good usability and a tasty design.

I'm a principal engineer at [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/) where I look build and maintain the main news site. Before that I was lead front-end developer at Breakthrough Media where I built some interesting projects to do with social challenges such as extremism and conflict. 

If you want to get in touch about a project you think may be of interest to me, my email address is [chris@chrisboakes.com](mailto:chris@chrisboakes.com).

When I’m not writing code, I work hard with my band [Young Astronaut](https://youngastronaut.co.uk/) and enjoy [taking pictures](https://www.instagram.com/crboakes/):
